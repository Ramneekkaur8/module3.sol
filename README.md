# Solidity Smart Contracts Example

This repository contains a set of Solidity smart contracts that demonstrate various error handling mechanisms and contract functionalities. The contracts are written in Solidity, a programming language used for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Introduction

These contracts showcase different error handling mechanisms and functionalities commonly used in Solidity smart contracts. Each contract has a specific purpose and demonstrates a particular concept.

## Contracts

### AssertExample

This contract demonstrates the use of the `assert` statement for handling unexpected conditions. It includes a function `example` that takes an input `x` and returns the result of `10 / x`. It uses an `assert` statement to ensure that `x` is not zero, as dividing by zero would result in an invalid operation.

### RevertExample

The `RevertExample` contract shows how to use the `require` statement to enforce preconditions before executing a function. It includes a function `withdraw` that allows users to withdraw an `amount` from their available `balance`. If the requested `amount` exceeds the available `balance`, the transaction is reverted with the error message "Insufficient balance."

### RequireExample

Similar to the `RevertExample` contract, the `RequireExample` contract uses the `require` statement to enforce preconditions. It also provides a function `withdraw` to allow users to withdraw an `amount`. If the requested `amount` exceeds the available `balance`, the transaction is reverted with the error message "Insufficient balance."

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Deploy the contracts on a testnet or mainnet Ethereum network using tools like Remix or Truffle.

3. Interact with the contracts by calling their functions. Observe how transactions succeed or revert based on the contract logic.
